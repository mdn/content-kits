  MDN Content Kits
</h1>

<p>
  MDN Content Kits are everything you need to host a local developer meetup or present on a technical topic at an event.

<p>
Each MDN Content Kit contains a collection of resources about a particular topic related to web development or web app development, such as Web APIs, useful libraries, or developer tools. Resource may include slides, demos, videos, exercises, etc.

  By providing MDN Content Kits, MDN hopes to grow developer engagement with Mozilla at a local level, and increase standards-based web development globally.

  Valence is the public-facing name for the Firefox Developer Tools Adapters, which extend the Firefox WebIDE to allow for remotely debugging pages in Chrome or Safari from within the Firefox Developer Tools. Valence is still in development and is experimental. Valence is distributed as an add-on which is automatically downloaded and installed by Firefox Developer Edition, though the raw .xpi file is available on ftp.mozilla.org and its source code is on GitHub.

<p>
  The Valance Content Kit is for an experienced web developer to give a presentation to a group of experienced web developers.
